# Manual for Virtuous Vanquisher of Evil

## Where are my Quality of Life features?!

Well, this game is done with Pico-8. If you don't know what that is please look HERE. Basically, I decided to remove QoL features to be able to add game stuff (like more items/skills/enemy types.)

### I can't loot!

Your inventory is probably full, you need to remove some items from your inventory first.

1. Go to your mule inventory
2. Go to the saddlebags section and an item you want to remove.
3. Press X and a small delete symbol will appear
4. Press X again and the item will be gone.
5. Try looting the chest again

### How much damage do I do?

All swords, bows and magic does 1 damage. There are 2 exceptions:

1. Sharp swords do 2 damage
2. Ice will only do damage if the enemy is already frozen. (This also applies to you)

### I want to start over!

Ok!

1. Have a -bolt book.
2. Unequip all items except the book
3. Pick the bolt skill and start the game
4. Reset the cart
5. Now you'll have the start sword equipped

From there you can unequip the book and continue playing.

### Skills

There are active skills and passive skills. Active skills you have to assign to a button (buttons) to use. Passive skills happens automatically, without your input.

#### Active Skills

- Sword attack (all swords except Useless ones) give this skill. It lets you swing your sword.
- Bow attack (all bows except Useless ones) give this skill. It lets you fire an arrow with your bow.
- Firebolt/Icebolt. Summon a bolt and unleash it upon your enemies.

#### Passive skills

- Resurrect. This is one of the two only ways to regain life without dying. (The other way is to slay The Evil.)
- Phasing. If you get hit you will teleport to a nearby random location. This skill stacks so if yo have more phasing skills you could potentially get further away.
- Cannot be burned. If you get hit with a fire attack you take 1 damage and (e.g. troll casters or firebats) you will lose control until you've stopped burning. But with this skill you will not start to burn, you'll still receive 1 damage though.
- Cannot be frozen. If you get hit with an ice attack you take 1 damage and (e.g. demon casters) you will freeze until you've thawed. But with this skill you will not freeze, you'll still receive 1 damage though.
